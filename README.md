# FamilyCash Manager

FamilyCash Manager is a practical web application designed to simplify family expense tracking. The system introduces two key roles: "Parent" and "Child." Parents have comprehensive control, managing overall family expenses and overseeing roles. Children have a simpler interface, focusing on tracking their personal expenses independently.

## Project Description
FamilyCash Manager streamlines the process of tracking family expenses by providing a user-friendly platform for both parents and children. With features like expense categorization and shared budgeting, it promotes financial awareness and responsibility within the family unit.
