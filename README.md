# FamilyCash Manager

FamilyCash Manager is a practical web application designed to simplify family expense tracking. The system introduces two key roles: "Parent" and "Child." Parents have comprehensive control, managing overall family expenses and overseeing roles. Children have a simpler interface, focusing on tracking their personal expenses independently.

## Features
1. Expense Categorization
   - Allow users (both parents and children) to categorize their expenses (e.g., groceries, entertainment, education). This enables better expense tracking and budgeting analysis.

2. Shared Budgeting & Goal Setting
   - Parents can set overall family budget goals.
   - Allow parents to define spending limits for child accounts. This fosters financial responsibility and teaches children about budgeting.
